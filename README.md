# Easter-Website

Just a simple website I made for an my college's Easter assignment in 2021. The teacher noticed that a lot of us were bad at visual design so we were tasked with making the cheesiest website possible. Naturally, I took this as an oppertunity to put a loop of James May saying cheese in it.

It also ended up looking like an old website because they were usually pretty ugly.
